# Console UI testing

Use this skill when the Java console application's interactive behaviour needs to be checked against documented test cases.

The source of truth is [test/ui-test-plan.md](../../../test/ui-test-plan.md). Keep every test case there, including its aim, newline-separated console inputs, and its complete expected standard output. Do not put test cases only in chat or in the runner.

## Test-plan format

The plan contains one `## Program command` shell block and one or more `## Test case: <name>` sections. Each test case must have these fields:

- `### Aim` — what user-facing behaviour the session verifies.
- `### Inputs` — a fenced text block; each line is entered into the console.
- `### Expected output` — a fenced text block containing the complete stdout, including prompts and blank lines.

Use a fresh program process for every test case. A test session must include a command that exits the program; otherwise the runner will time out.

## Run the tests

From the repository root, run:

```sh
python3 .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py
```

The runner requires Java 25, executes the documented program command for each case, and compares stdout exactly after normalising Windows line endings. It prints a console-input and console-output transcript for every session. On the first failure it immediately stops, displays the expected and actual outputs (plus stderr or a non-zero exit status when applicable), and returns a non-zero exit code.

When changing UI behaviour, update the affected expected-output blocks deliberately, then rerun the complete plan. Do not alter expected output merely to conceal an unintended regression.
